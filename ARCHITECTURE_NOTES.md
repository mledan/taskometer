# Architecture Notes for Future Development

## Current State (Browser-Only Implementation)
All data is stored in browser localStorage. This includes:
- User schedules and templates
- Task data
- Active schedule selection
- Task history

## Future Architecture Considerations

### 1. Backend Infrastructure (When Ready to Scale)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing:
  - User accounts and authentication
  - Schedule templates (famous and community)
  - Task data with timestamps
  - Analytics and metrics
  - Community ratings and comments

- **API Server**: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI for:
  - User authentication (JWT tokens)
  - Schedule CRUD operations
  - Community features (sharing, rating, commenting)
  - Analytics aggregation
  - Real-time sync across devices

- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar for:
  - User profile pictures
  - Schedule template thumbnails
  - Export files

### 2. Authentication & User Management
- OAuth integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Email/password authentication
- User profiles with preferences
- Multi-device sync

### 3. Community Features
- Public schedule library with search/filter
- User ratings and reviews
- Following system for schedule creators
- Comments and discussions on schedules
- Schedule versioning and forking

### 4. Analytics & Insights
- Time tracking accuracy (planned vs actual)
- Productivity metrics and trends
- Schedule adherence scoring
- Comparative analytics with similar users
- Weekly/monthly reports via email

### 5. Advanced Features
- **AI Integration**:
  - Smart schedule recommendations based on user behavior
  - Automatic task categorization
  - Optimal schedule generation based on goals
  - Natural language task input

- **Calendar Integration**:
  - Google Calendar sync
  - Outlook integration
  - iCal support
  - Two-way sync with external calendars

- **Mobile Apps**:
  - React Native for iOS/Android
  - Push notifications for task reminders
  - Offline support with sync
  - Widget support for quick task entry

### 6. Real-time Features
- WebSocket connections for:
  - Live schedule updates
  - Collaborative scheduling
  - Real-time analytics
  - Notification system

### 7. Premium Features (Monetization)
- Unlimited custom schedules
- Advanced analytics
- Team/family scheduling
- Priority support
- Export to various formats
- API access for integrations

- [ ] Export/Import via JSON files
- [ ] Browser notifications

### Phase 3: Basic Backend
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Cloud storage for schedules
- [ ] Basic sync across devices
- [ ] Community schedule browsing

### Phase 4: Full Platform
- [ ] Complete API
- [ ] Mobile apps
- [ ] Advanced analytics
- [ ] AI features
- [ ] Premium subscriptions

## Technical Debt to Address
1. Separate business logic from UI components
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Implement proper state management (Redux/Zustand)
4. Add unit and integration tests
5. Optimize bundle size
6. Implement proper TypeScript types
7. Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
8. Implement i18n for internationalization

## Security Considerations for Future
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- GDPR compliance for user data
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input sanitization
- XSS and CSRF protection
- Regular security audits
- Privacy-first design

## Performance Optimizations Needed
- Code splitting for faster initial load
- Lazy loading of components
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Image optimization
- CDN for static assets
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies

## Data Structure Improvements
- Normalize schedule data structure
- Add versioning to schedule templates
- Implement conflict resolution for sync
- Add audit trails for changes
- Implement soft deletes
- Add data validation schemas
