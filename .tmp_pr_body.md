Audit polish fixes for existing pages

What changed
- Restored Community tab in navigation and added data-tour target
- Added keyboard shortcuts: g+d Dashboard, g+p Palace, g+m Community
- Fixed AuditLogViewer import (use AUDIT_ACTIONS) to resolve build warning
- Expanded OnboardingTour with Dashboard, Palace, Community steps and updated copy
- Fixed WeekView context menu bug (COMPLETE_TASK/PAUSE_TASK dispatched wrong payload)

Why
- Ensure all pages are discoverable and consistent with the tour and shortcuts
- Eliminate build warnings and broken context-menu actions in Calendar

Verification
- npm test: 4/4 passing
- npm run build: success (~119KB gzipped app bundle)

Notes
- Google Calendar sync requires env vars; component degrades gracefully if not configured
- TagManager, ScheduleUploader/Applicator exist as utilities but are not exposed in the main nav (intentional)
